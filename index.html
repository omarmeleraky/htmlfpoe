        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Cairo is the capital city of Egypt, home to one of the seven miracles of the world. Many tourists go to Cairo having only one thing on their mind, visiting the pyramids. <br>However, there are countless activities the tourists are missing out on, for example, having dinner on a yacht at night in the Nile River, visiting the Egyptian museum, <br>going to the Cairo Opera House and enjoying the stunning performances from ballet to opera, and much more. </p>

        <p>In this website, I will share my top three experiences tourists should at least experience once while in Cairo aside from going to the pyramids.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boat Ride on the Nile River</li>
            <li>Evening Performances at the Cairo Opera House</li>
            <li>Stroll through Khan El Khalili Bazaar</li>
        </ul>

            <p>Imagine going on a boat ride during the sunset in the Nile River, <br>sightseeing some of Cairo's historic sites and beautiful architectures, <br>and having dinner in the lovely weather during the sunset on the boat.</p>

            <p>The main performing arts venue in Egypt. Home to Egypt's brightest and <br>finest musical groups. It was actually funded by Japan as a gift to Egypt, <br>it opened in October 1988. Before going to the Opera House, people can <br>spend some time exploring the wonderful Zamalek district and enjoy the <br>comforting vibes and historical sites.</p>

            <p>The vibrant market located in Islamic Cairo. In my opinion, this is the <br>best place a tourist can go to in Cairo. It is full of shops that sell a wide <br>variety of items from local crafts to souvenirs and even high-end jewellery. <br>But the best thing in this place is you will go and see the pure Egyptian <br>hospitality, everyone is welcoming, most of the vendors speak english, and <br>bargaining is almost considered a fun activity while you are there.</p>
